							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							For most of my life, I wanted to become a professional artist. In 2020, I began attending
							college for an AAS in graphic design to develop my skills so I could pursue that goal.
							Unfortunately, I found it unfulfilling and dull; marketing, logo design, branding&mdash;none
							of it appealed to me. Although I never found enjoyment in graphic
							design, I'm glad I finished the degree because it led me to my true passion when I took a
							web development class in my last semester.
						</p>
						<p>
							Using logic to style and build a website was satisfying in a way that graphic design had
							never been. It made me want to explore paths I had never considered for before, and
							in 2023 I started pursuing an AAS in computer programming. It was difficult at times, but
							I had never been so motivated to learn and overcome the challenges.
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, I'm searching for a full-time programming job tha will push the limits of my
							knowledge and provide unique challenges to help me further hone the skills I developed in
							school. My preferred language is Java, but I also have experience with Python, JavaScript,
							and C#.
